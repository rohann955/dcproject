        <p><b>White House</b></p>
        <p>On Thursday, we got to see the Bill of Rights First Amendment in action during our visit to the White House. The First Amendment protects 5 basic rights, Freedom of Religion, Freedom of Assembly, Freedom of the Press to report, Freedom of Petition, and Freedom of Speech. We got to see some of these rights being exercised as we observed several protests in designated areas on the street. These included protests of current issues such as the invasion of Ukraine, the Black Lives Matter movement, and a protest by the group Free Tibet. </p>

        <p><b>Capitol Hill</b></p>
        <p>On Thursday we visited the Capitol Hill. In front of the Capitol Building, we got to ask questions to two members of Senator Patti Murray's staff. I was thinking to ask them about their experience with the January 6th, 2021 events at the Capitol Building, but I was afraid that it would be too much. The Capitol Building is where the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives come together to help pass laws, representing the opinions of the citizens who elected them to office. The main powers of the legislative branch is making laws. They can also do other things such as impeach officials, collecting taxes, and  regulating spending policies.

        <p><b>Gettysburg</b></p>
        <p>On Wednesday we had to get up super early to make the long trip to the battlefield in Gettysburg, PA. I could barely stay awake during the bus ride, but by the time we got there I was fully ready to soak in a lot of historical information. The museum was packed with information and artifacts on the Battle of Gettysburg and the Civil War, but the real highlight came in the afternoon when our tour guide Charlie took us around the memorials and battlefield, guiding us through how the influential turning point of the war played out, and even letting us stand near places where Confederate and Union soldiers and generals, such as  Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant, made their famous stands. Charlie mixed all this information in with a great sense of humor, which meant that all of us were truly having fun while learning a lot about American History.

        <p><b>Sad and Angry</b></p>
        <p>There were some more somber moments on our trip, namely the Holocaust museum, the Pentagon 9/11 memorial, and the slavery sections of the African American History and Culture Museum. Each of these places taught us more about injustices that occurred and lives that were lost during specific crisises. It made me angry for the people who lost their lives and lost loved ones because of other people's evil in the world. The African American Museum wasn't all about slavery, though - it had information on several important leaders in the Civil Rights Movement, such as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. which helped us think more about being upstanding citizens and leaders. In addition, it had nice exhibits on African American inspired arts. I specifically enjoyed the music one the most. I had lots of fun learning more about some of my favorite artists such as Prince and Kendrick Lamar, their impact on African American music and culture, and their advocacy in and outside of their work against racism.

        <p><b>Shear Madness</b></p>
        <p>On Thursday night, we went to see an improvised play at the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts, "Shear Madness", that got the whole grade laughing. The play was a murder mystery set in a barbershop. The outcome of the mystery changes each night. We were wowed by the ability of the actors for seemingly effortlessly pulling off an improvised conclusion to the rollercoaster plot while still cracking some hilarious jokes along the way (though some of them probably made our teachers a little bit awkward…).</p>

        <p><b>Memorials</b></p>
        <p>We went to several famous memorials of important figures and events in American History, such as Thomas Jefferson, FDR, and World War 2 (above) memorials. The memorials themselves were very nice, but the best part of visiting them was the discussions that were facilitated by the instructors of CloseUP. They implored us to look deeper into the lives and legacies of the people that were memorialized and see how they lived up to American values, and how we could apply som of the good principles in their lives to our lives today.</p>

    <h4><b>So why was the trip impactful?</b></h4>
    <p>After studying the Constitution and every different detail of our government for a month, it was exciting and refreshing to go to the city that makes it all happen. There are many things I will remember from this great trip, but most of all, the biggest thing I learned was the power of my own voice, and citizen action. Seeing powerful icons like Martin Luther King Jr., Abraham Lincoln, and Malcolm X, and how they captured the room through their powerful words, it showed how an otherwise regular citizen could inspire </p>
